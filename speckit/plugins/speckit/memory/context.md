## Key Conventions

### Naming Conventions

- **Files:** [e.g., kebab-case for files, PascalCase for classes]
- **Functions:** [e.g., camelCase, verb-first naming]
- **Variables:** [e.g., descriptive names, avoid abbreviations]
- **Constants:** [e.g., SCREAMING_SNAKE_CASE]

### Code Style

- [Indentation preference: spaces/tabs, count]
- [Line length limits]
- [Import ordering conventions]
- [Comment style preferences]

### Testing Patterns

- **Test Location:** [e.g., `tests/` directory, co-located with source]
- **Test Naming:** [e.g., `*.test.js`, `*_test.py`]
- **Test Framework:** [e.g., Jest, pytest, Go testing]
- **Coverage Requirements:** [e.g., minimum 80% coverage]

### Git Workflow

- **Branch Naming:** [e.g., `feature/`, `fix/`, `docs/`]
- **Commit Style:** [e.g., conventional commits, imperative mood]
- **PR Requirements:** [e.g., require reviews, CI must pass]

## Common Gotchas

### Environment Setup

- [ ] [Gotcha 1: e.g., Requires Node.js v18+, older versions will fail silently]
- [ ] [Gotcha 2: e.g., Must run `npm install` before any scripts]

### Code Patterns

- [ ] [Gotcha 3: e.g., Always use async/await, never raw promises]
- [ ] [Gotcha 4: e.g., Database connections must be closed explicitly]

### Build/Deploy

- [ ] [Gotcha 5: e.g., Build artifacts go to `dist/`, not `build/`]
- [ ] [Gotcha 6: e.g., Environment variables must be set before build]

### Testing

- [ ] [Gotcha 7: e.g., Tests require local database running]
- [ ] [Gotcha 8: e.g., Some tests are flaky on CI, retry once]
