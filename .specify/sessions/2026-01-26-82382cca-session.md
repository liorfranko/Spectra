## Current State

Ran comprehensive validation of the 002-projspec-claude-code feature specification using `/speckit.validate`. The validation checked all artifacts (spec.md, plan.md, research.md, data-model.md, quickstart.md) for completeness, consistency, and alignment.

**Overall Status: PASS WITH WARNINGS**

The specification and planning artifacts are in good shape with no critical issues. Several warnings identified for follow-up.

### Completed
- [x] Ran full validation across 7 categories (Spec Completeness, Constitution Alignment, Cross-Artifact Consistency, Terminology, Testability, Clarity, Leftover Detection)
- [x] Generated validation report with cross-reference matrix
- [x] Identified 8 warnings that should be addressed before implementation

### In Progress
- [ ] Waiting for user decision on which warnings to fix

### Notes for Next Session
- **W1**: Constitution is still a template - run `/speckit.constitution` to customize
- **W2**: tasks.md does not exist - run `/speckit.tasks` to generate
- **W3**: No CLI contracts defined in `contracts/` directory
- **W4**: No checklists defined in `checklists/` directory
- **W5**: Edge cases in spec.md need concrete resolutions (6 questions without answers)
- **W6**: SC-005 and SC-011 have vague measurement criteria
- **W7**: Archive feature scenario missing from quickstart.md
- **W8**: state.yaml will be created during implementation (expected)
