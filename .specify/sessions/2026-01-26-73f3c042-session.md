# Session: 2026-01-26-73f3c042

**Feature**: 005-rename-speckit-projspec (Rename SpecKit to ProjSpec)
**Branch**: `005-rename-speckit-projspec`
**Started**: 2026-01-26
**Purpose**: PR Review before merge

## Current State

**Phase**: PR Review Complete - Ready for PR

Comprehensive PR review completed using 4 specialized review agents in parallel. After clarification, most initially flagged issues were false positives - the `.specify/` folder is the speckit tool managing this project, so those `/speckit.*` references are correct. Only minor issues remain.

## Completed Tasks

### PR Review Execution
- [x] Ran `/projspec.review-pr` command
- [x] Identified review scope (74 changed files)
- [x] Loaded constitution for compliance checking
- [x] Executed 4 review agents in parallel:
  - code-reviewer: General quality and consistency
  - silent-failure-hunter: Error handling in shell scripts
  - comment-analyzer: Documentation accuracy after rename
  - code-simplifier: Code clarity opportunities
- [x] Aggregated all review findings
- [x] Generated comprehensive PR review report
- [x] Clarified false positives with user (`.specify/` folder is speckit tool, not projspec product)

### Review Report Generated
- [x] Created `specs/005-rename-speckit-projspec/checklists/pr-review-report.md`
- [x] Initial report documented issues (later clarified as mostly false positives)
- [x] Corrected understanding: `.specify/` references to speckit are intentional

## In Progress Items

None - review complete, ready for PR.

## Pending Tasks (Optional Improvements)

### Minor Issues (2 items - can fix now or in follow-up)
- [ ] Fix `CLAUDE.md` - Truncated technology descriptions (lines 6, 31) - "Gi" should be "Git, GitHub CLI..."
- [ ] Fix `projspec/plugins/projspec/scripts/update-agent-context.sh` - Add temp file cleanup trap

### Code Quality Suggestions (from projspec plugin scripts)
- [ ] Add error checking to directory creation in setup scripts
- [ ] Improve copy operation error reporting
- [ ] Consolidate JSON escaping logic into single function
- [ ] Consolidate redundant error handling pattern

## Review Statistics

| Metric | Value |
|--------|-------|
| Files Reviewed | 74 |
| Review Agents Used | 4 |
| Execution Mode | Parallel |
| Actual Issues | 2 minor |
| False Positives | 5 (`.specify/` folder correctly uses speckit) |
| Suggestions | 4 |

## Key Findings

### False Positives Identified
The `.specify/` folder is the speckit tool managing THIS project, so these are NOT issues:
- `.specify/scripts/bash/*.sh` - correctly references `/speckit.*` commands
- `.specify/templates/*.md` - correctly references `/speckit.*` commands
- Comments referencing "spec-kit repo" are correct

### Verified Clean Directories (projspec product)
- `projspec/` - All 52 files clean, no speckit references
- `.claude/commands/` - All 14 files use `/projspec.*`
- `projspec/plugins/projspec/` - Properly renamed

### Actual Issues
1. `CLAUDE.md` has truncated technology descriptions ("Gi" instead of "Git")
2. `update-agent-context.sh` could use temp file cleanup trap

## Notes for Next Session

1. **Ready for PR** - The rename is complete and correct

2. **Optional fixes before PR**:
   - Fix CLAUDE.md truncated descriptions
   - Add temp file cleanup trap

3. **Key distinction to remember**:
   - `.specify/` = speckit tool (manages this project) → uses `/speckit.*` commands
   - `projspec/` = projspec product (being built) → uses `/projspec.*` commands

## Lessons Learned

1. **Distinguish tool from product**: The `.specify/` folder is the speckit tool managing the project, NOT part of the projspec product being built. These should NOT be renamed.

2. **Parallel agent execution is efficient**: Running 4 review agents simultaneously completed the comprehensive review quickly

3. **User clarification prevents false fixes**: Initial review flagged many false positives that would have broken the speckit tooling if "fixed"

4. **Context matters for renames**: A project can use one tool (speckit) to build another product (projspec) - the tool references should remain unchanged
