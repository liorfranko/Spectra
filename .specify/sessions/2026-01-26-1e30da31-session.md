## Current State

Fixed Python environment configuration for the project. The project now has:
- `.python-version` set to Python 3.10.13 (via pyenv local)
- `.venv` virtual environment created with `uv venv`

The project is not yet configured as an installable Python package (no `pyproject.toml` or `setup.py`).

### Completed
- [x] Diagnosed pyenv was using Python 2.7.18 globally (incompatible with `uv`)
- [x] Set Python 3.10.13 for this project via `pyenv local 3.10.13`
- [x] Created virtual environment with `uv venv`

### In Progress
- [ ] Project needs `pyproject.toml` to be installable as a Python package

### Notes for Next Session
- User needs to decide if they want to create a `pyproject.toml` for this project
- To activate the venv: `source .venv/bin/activate`
- Python 3.10.13 is now the default for this directory

### Context to Load
```
.python-version
.venv/
```
