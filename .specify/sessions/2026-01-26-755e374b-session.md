## Current State

Q&A session - user asked how to run the projspec CLI, tested it, and asked about running from outside the worktree.

### Completed
- [x] Explored project structure to locate CLI entry point
- [x] Found CLI at `worktrees/001-projspec-mvp/src/projspec/cli.py`
- [x] Reviewed pyproject.toml to understand CLI configuration
- [x] Provided instructions for running the CLI via `uv run projspec`
- [x] Tested CLI with `--help` flag - works correctly
- [x] Tested `status` command - correctly reports ProjSpec not initialized
- [x] Provided options for running CLI outside the worktree
- [x] Tested `uv run --project <path> projspec` - confirmed working

### In Progress
- [ ] None

### Notes for Next Session
- The projspec CLI is in the worktree at `worktrees/001-projspec-mvp/`
- CLI supports two commands: `init` and `status`
- Run from worktree: `cd worktrees/001-projspec-mvp && uv run projspec <command>`
- Run from anywhere: `uv run --project <path-to-worktree> projspec <command>`
- Can also install globally with pipx or create a shell alias
- There's a warning about VIRTUAL_ENV mismatch - can be ignored or use `--active` flag

### Context to Load
```
worktrees/001-projspec-mvp/pyproject.toml
worktrees/001-projspec-mvp/src/projspec/cli.py
```
