## Current State

User attempted to install the project in editable mode using `uv pip install -e .` from the main project root (`/Users/liorfr/Development/projspec`). This failed because `pyproject.toml` doesn't exist in the root directory - it's located in the worktree at `worktrees/001-projspec-mvp/`.

### Completed
- [x] Diagnosed why `uv pip install -e .` failed in root directory
- [x] Located existing `pyproject.toml` in worktree

### In Progress
- [ ] User needs to decide: work from worktree or add pyproject.toml to root

### Notes for Next Session
- The project uses a worktree structure where `worktrees/001-projspec-mvp/` contains the active development code
- To install in editable mode, run from the worktree: `cd worktrees/001-projspec-mvp && uv pip install -e .`
- Alternatively, a `pyproject.toml` could be added to the root if that workflow is preferred

### Context to Load
```
worktrees/001-projspec-mvp/pyproject.toml
worktrees/001-projspec-mvp/src/
```
