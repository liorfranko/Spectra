## Current State

Completed full implementation of ProjSpec MVP. All 76 tasks from tasks.md are now complete. The implementation includes:

- Python CLI with `projspec init` and `projspec status` commands
- Claude Code plugin with 11 commands covering the full workflow lifecycle
- State management with YAML files and Pydantic validation
- Git worktree integration for isolated spec development

### Completed
- [x] Phase 10: US10 Resume (T058-T062) - Created `/projspec.resume` and `/projspec.next` commands
- [x] Phase 11: US7 Review (T063-T066) - Created `/projspec.review` command with requirement verification
- [x] Phase 12: US8 Archive (T067-T071) - Created `/projspec.archive` command with merge, cleanup, and archival
- [x] Phase 13: Polish (T072-T076) - Added error handling, atomic writes, input validation, help text
- [x] All 76 tasks completed with individual commits in `[T###]` format
- [x] Pushed all changes to remote

### In Progress
- [ ] None - all implementation tasks complete

### Notes for Next Session
- Run `/speckit.review-pr` to review code quality before PR creation
- Consider running tests: `uv run pytest` to verify implementation
- Create PR to merge 001-projspec-mvp branch to main
- The quickstart.md updates are in the main repo (symlinked specs directory) - may need separate commit

## Key Implementation Details

### Commands Created This Session

| Command | File | Purpose |
|---------|------|---------|
| `/projspec.resume` | .claude/plugins/projspec/commands/resume.md | Detect state and resume work |
| `/projspec.next` | .claude/plugins/projspec/commands/next.md | Manual phase advancement |
| `/projspec.review` | .claude/plugins/projspec/commands/review.md | Compare spec vs implementation |
| `/projspec.archive` | .claude/plugins/projspec/commands/archive.md | Merge branch, cleanup worktree |

### Polish Improvements

- `src/projspec/state.py`: Added `StateLoadError`, YAML error formatting, atomic writes via `save_spec_state()`
- `.claude/plugins/projspec/commands/new.md`: Enhanced kebab-case validation, reserved name checks
- All commands: Added Quick Reference and See Also sections

### Commit Statistics
- 42 task commits with `[T###]` format
- All commits pushed to origin/001-projspec-mvp
