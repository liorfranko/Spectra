## Current State

Created and refined a feature specification for ProjSpec - a clean reimplementation of GitHub's spec-kit focused on Mac/Linux and Claude Code only. Key clarification: this is NOT a new product, but a better-engineered version of spec-kit with the same workflow and prompts, designed as a foundation for future experimentation.

### Completed
- [x] Created feature branch `002-projspec-claude-code`
- [x] Generated comprehensive feature specification with 6 prioritized user stories
- [x] Defined 14 functional requirements
- [x] Added 5 spec-kit compatibility requirements (CR-001 through CR-005)
- [x] Added 6 code quality requirements (CQ-001 through CQ-006)
- [x] Established 12 measurable success criteria (including extensibility metrics)
- [x] Created specification quality checklist (all 16 items passing)
- [x] Documented assumptions, scope boundaries, and "Out of Scope" section
- [x] Clarified goal: same workflow/prompts as spec-kit, cleaner code, foundation for experimentation

### In Progress
- [ ] None - specification phase complete

### Notes for Next Session
- Specification is ready for `/speckit.plan` to generate implementation plan
- Key design goals to remember during planning:
  - Same slash commands as spec-kit (`/speckit.specify`, `/speckit.plan`, etc.)
  - Same prompt templates and output formats
  - Modular code where each command is isolated in its own file
  - Easy to add new workflow steps without modifying existing commands
- The spec explicitly excludes: Windows, other AI assistants, new features not in spec-kit
- Future experimentation will involve adding NEW steps, not changing existing ones
