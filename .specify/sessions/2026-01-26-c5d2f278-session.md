## Current State

Completed `/speckit.plan` command execution for feature 002-projspec-claude-code. This is a clean reimplementation of GitHub's spec-kit for Mac/Linux and Claude Code only. All Phase 0 (Research) and Phase 1 (Design & Contracts) artifacts have been generated.

**Key Design Decisions**:
1. **Git worktrees by default** - Each feature gets its own worktree directory for complete filesystem isolation
2. **No Claude Code plugin** - Commands delivered as prompt templates in `.specify/templates/commands/` instead

### Completed
- [x] Ran setup-plan.sh to initialize plan.md from template
- [x] Filled Technical Context in plan.md (Python 3.11+, Bash 4.0+, typer/rich/pydantic stack)
- [x] Completed Constitution Check (all gates pass)
- [x] Defined Project Structure (CLI, scripts, templates, tests - NO plugin)
- [x] Created research.md with 11 technology decisions and rationale
- [x] Created data-model.md with 7 entity definitions and state schemas
- [x] Created contracts/cli-interface.md with CLI and command template contracts
- [x] Created quickstart.md with 10 validation scenarios
- [x] Updated CLAUDE.md agent context via update-agent-context.sh
- [x] **Added worktree-first design to all artifacts**
- [x] **Removed Claude Code plugin - replaced with prompt templates**:
  - Updated plan.md to remove plugin references
  - Updated research.md section 2 to "Command Prompt Templates (No Plugin)"
  - Updated contracts/cli-interface.md to document template usage
  - Updated quickstart.md to use "Read X and follow those instructions" pattern

### In Progress
- [ ] None - plan phase complete

### Notes for Next Session
- Run `/speckit.tasks` to generate the task breakdown for implementation
- Tasks should follow the phased structure: Setup → Foundation → User Stories (P1/P2/P3) → Polish
- **Implementation will create**:
  - Python CLI package (`src/projspec_cli/`)
  - Bash scripts (`scripts/*.sh`)
  - Command prompt templates (`.specify/templates/commands/*.md`)
  - Document templates (`.specify/templates/*.md`)
- **Worktree-specific implementation notes**:
  - `create-new-feature.sh` must create worktree + symlinks
  - `archive-feature.sh` must handle merge + worktree removal
  - `common.sh` needs worktree-aware path resolution functions
- **No plugin needed** - commands are prompt templates users load via Read tool
